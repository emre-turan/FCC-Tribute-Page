            <h3 id="headline">Highlights from Robert Moog's life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Born in New York City, New York</li>
                <li><strong>1949</strong> - aged 14, he built a theremin </li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science </li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - Moog produced his own theremin design, and the following year he published
                    an article on the theremin in Radio and Television News. In the same year, he founded RA Moog,
                    selling theremins and theremin kits by mail order from his home as he completed his education </li>
                <li><strong>1964</strong> - Moog began creating the Moog synthesizer. It was composed of separate
                    modules which created and shaped sounds, connected by patch cords. Previous synthesizers, such as
                    the RCA Mark II, had created sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes. Instead, Moog used recently
                    available silicon transistors â€” specifically, transistors with an exponential relationship between
                    input voltage and output current. With these, he created the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO),
                    which generated a waveform whose pitch could be adjusted by changing the voltage. Similarly, he used
                    voltage to control loudness with voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). One innovative feature was
                    its envelope, which controlled how notes swell and fade. According to the Guardian, Moog's 1964
                    paper Voltage-Controlled Music Modules, in which he proposed the Moog synthesizer modules, invented
                    the modern concept of the analog synthesizer. </li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - The Moog synthesizer was followed by a more portable model, the Minimoog,
                    described as the most famous and influential synthesizer in history. </li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - Moog was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor on April 28,
                    and he died on August 21 </li>
            </ul>
